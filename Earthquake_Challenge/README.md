# JavaScript Eartquake Mapping Challenge
### Using JavaScript and APIs to Create Interactive Earthquake Maps

The Module 14 assignments and challenge taught us how to use an API, Mapbox, and fine tune our JavaScript to create an interactive map of
earthquakes around the world. Our map included three layers: satellite, street, and dark. The map also included the ability to toggle the
map to show earthquakes, techtonic plates, or major earthquake data.
